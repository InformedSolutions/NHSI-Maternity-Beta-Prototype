                    This website is run by NHS England and NHS Improvement. We want as many people as possible to be
                    able to use this website.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For example, that means you should be able to:
                </p>

                <ul class="list list-bullet">
                    <li>
                        use your web browser to change colours, contrast levels and fonts
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS,
                        NVDA and VoiceOver)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        access the website using a mobile or tablet.

                <p>
                    On sections that don’t provide technical information, we’ve also made the website text as simple as
                    possible to understand.
